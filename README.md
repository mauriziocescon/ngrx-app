Demo built on ngrx 13.x using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
=========

## Demo

1. [Demo](https://mc-ngrx-app.herokuapp.com) powered by Heroku

## Backend implementation

1. Based on [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with mocks from [faker](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js)

2. Run `npm run build` and `npm start` in order to launch the server (`http://localhost:3000`) with the distribution version of the app (APIs available at `http://localhost:3000/api/`)

3. The server randomly simulates delays and errors for testing purposes

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
